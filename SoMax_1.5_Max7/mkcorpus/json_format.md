Each item of the list "data" contains a dictionary representing a single state, which may contain zero, one or multiple notes.

"seg": Don't know. Always [1, 0]

"state": Index of current state (in [0, size-1])

"slice": Consists of two numbers:
    0. Represents fundamental, virtual fundamental or no fundamental: 0-127 represents midi pitches, 128-139 virtual fundamentals (0-11) and 140 represents no fundamental
    1. Don't know. is always 0.0

"beat": Consists of four numbers:
    0. Absolute beat as decimal (ex. 1.5 is middle of second beat)
    1. Tempo in BPM
    2. Don't know. is always 0.0
    3. Don't know. is always 0.0

"time": Consists of two numbers:
    0. Absolute position of state beginning in ms
    1. Duration in ms

"notes": List of dicts, where each dict contains two entries:
    "note": [nn, vel, ch],
    "time": [onset relative to state start, offset (noteoff) relative to state start]

"extras": Twelve floats representing chroma
